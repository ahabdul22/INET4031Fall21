# For practice, let's have Vagrant copy a file out to the server.
# This file won't do anything, but is just an example of how we could
# Transfer a file of database users for example.  Some future
# automation would use add users to the database.  
# On your windows or mac, create an empty text file named "users.sql"
# put it in the SAME DIRECTORY as where this Vagrantfile is located.
# Then have Vagrant copy it out to the server.
# Research how to do this on the web. 
#
# Vagrantâ€™s own docs are best: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/file

# put your killer command for copying a file to the VM here.
# Remember that at this time the copying of this file serves no useful
# purposeful. It will soon.  Vagrant will copy the file into the
# /home/vagrant directory.
# Hint: your statement to copy users.sql should start like this:

 config.vm.provision "file", source: "/Users/Abdulrahman/module2vagrant", destination: "/home/vagrant"
